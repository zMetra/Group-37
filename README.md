## Description
We set out to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh by collecting data on various aspects of each area. We used datasets that included outdoor features of neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. The features/datasets we decided to use are pools, greenways, baseball fields, and water features. Using Python and several libraries/datasets, we analyzed this data and presented it in a visualization tool called the "Neighborhood Matrix." This matrix allows users to easily compare different neighborhoods side by side and see which ones stand out in terms of outdoor features. It also provides charts as well as maps of pictures with features plotted. By offering a comprehensive resource for decision making, our goal is to help residents choose the perfect location for living, working, and playing in Pittsburgh.
