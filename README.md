## Description
We set out to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh by collecting data on various aspects of each area. Using Python and several libraries/datasets, we analyzed this data and presented it in a visualization tool called the "Neighborhood Matrix." This matrix allows users to easily compare different neighborhoods side by side and see which ones stand out in terms of livability. It also provides interactive features, like filtering and sorting, so people can customize their search according to personal preferences. By offering a comprehensive resource for decision making, our goal is to help residents choose the perfect location for living, working, and playing in Pittsburgh.
